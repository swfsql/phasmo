# emoji-powered Phasmophobia evidence tracker

WIP utility to help tracking evidences for the Phasmophobia game.  

Information mostly taken from [fandom/phasmophobia](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Phasmophobia_Wiki) (8/oct/2020).

Should let the user "activate" evidences and narrow the ghost possibility,
and also let the user "forbid" evidences to narrow even further,
and also show some quick icons/information related to the ghosts,
eg. possibly troublesome features, possibly useful items, etc.

TODO: the GUI part.  
TODO: emoji-only option.  
TODO: optional sensible online doc.
